# First Interaction Frontend Framework (FIFF)

## what is this?
a new way to get to learn a front-end framework quickly\
just find the keyword on the project, and you will get the sample

## why I made this?
I made this to help my coworkers to speed up learning a framework. \
I'm bored because every question is always the same. \
Actually there are similarities in every front-end framework, \
so it's not too difficult to learn a new framework

## how to use this?
1. use the snippet code
2. find these keyword on the sample project
